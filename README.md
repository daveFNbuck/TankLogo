A tank war strategy built by [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). Share your ideas and strategies and win the game!

You can see two kinds of tank here:
- The Red one
- The Blue one

In this project, the red tank has a temporary strongest strategy, which means it is very strong and you may lose it easily. You can not modify the code of the red one, but you can modify the blue one, and make it better than the red one.

__If you have made your own red tank stronger than the blue tank__, You win! :collision:

You can submit your tank strategy (yours blue tank code) through a [pull request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/), and we will update our red tank code according to your blue tank code until there is another better blue tank to strategy beat yours. During this time, your github id and avatar will displaied in the `README.md` [here](https://github.com/huangyz0918/TankLogo#current-winner).

It's like a game of fighting, let's cheer, the first place is yours!


## What's NetLogo ?
You can checkout for more information at it's [homepage](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

Here is the definition of NetLogo programming language from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetLogo):

> NetLogo was designed, by Uri Wilensky, in the spirit of the Logo programming language, to be "low threshold and no ceiling". It teaches programming concepts using agents in the form of turtles, patches, links and the observer. NetLogo was designed for multiple audiences in mind, in particular: teaching children in the education community, and for domain experts without a programming background to model related phenomena. Many scientific articles have been published using NetLogo.

After all, it's a very easy programming language which can let you focus more on the programming logic of our battles.


## The Tank Battle Strategy

![](https://i.loli.net/2018/10/17/5bc6c7486353e.png)

Introduction to the UI:

- The `setup` button: Initialize the user interface.
- The `reset` button: Reset the war.
- The `go` button: Start animation and confrontation.
- You can use the `TankName` to put a name for your tank before creating it.
- You can set the `FirePower` through the progress bar, which is the power of per bullet.
- If you want to watch the track of tanks, you can set the `LeaveTrack?` to `on`.

The finite element state machine was used for the core part of this tank war game. We set the default status to `status-forward[v]` , `status-dodge-forward[args]` or `status-random-forward[tickNum]`, they have diffierent characteristics and downsides:

- In the status `status-forward[v]`, the tank will use the `v` as it's velocity to move forward.
- In status `status-back`, `status-right`, `status-left` and `status-stop`, the tank will go back, turn right/left and just stop.
- `status-random-forward[tickNum]` allows the tank to move forward at a random direction in a fixed time interval, which is can be set by input paramemter `tickNum`.
- `status-dodge-forward[args]` is a pretty tricky status, if other tank shooting by aiming at your tank, the best dodge strategy is to move in a direction perpendicular to its direction of motion, since the bullet has a delay before hitting yours.


## Contribution Guides

The NetLogo is a pretty easy programming language, we wish you can get start as soon as possible, so if you have any question about NetLogo, please check out for the official [document](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/index2.html).

In this project, the only area you can modify are marked in the code via comments, you cannot make any changes related to the red tank, or we wouldn't accept your PR and update yours strategy. 

In your code, you can not modify the opponent's attributes, such as resetting the health and velocity of the red tank, but you can detect others' attributes. For example, you can detect the patch of the red code using `patch-here`.

To do some contributions, you need to install NetLogo firstly then clone your fork, double click the `TankLogo.nlogo` and run!

## FAQ
Why choose NetLogo as a programming language? 
> Because NetLogo is quick easy and fewer people know how to use it than other languages. So everybody is equal at the start.

How do I start ?
> Two steps, the first is to install NetLogo. The second one is to clone this repo and double click the .nlogo file and improve the tank.

What do I get if I beat your tank ?
> The best tank will be updated according to your solution, and your Github avatar and name will display until somebody beats yours.

How do I submit my solution ?
> Fork this repo and improve your code, test if it can really beat my tank, submit a pull request, done!
